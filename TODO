To do:

- Change file owner to a safe user if the current owner is not member of the
  group with write-access to the file. (This takes care of users no longer
  member of the write-group still owning files and/or directories.)

- Allow single dir exceptions instead of always ignoring complete sub-trees.

- For files:
  - Give wgroup exactly the owner's permissions
  - Give rgroup the owner's permissions except write. Do not give (but allow)
    execute in case the file has sticky bits set.
